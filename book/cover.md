# Cover

To make your book more elegant on GitBook, you can specify a cover.

A cover is specified by a **cover.jpg** file, a **cover_small.jpg** can also exist as a smaller version of the cover. The cover should be a **JPEG** file.

### Best Sizes

|  | Big | Small |
| -- | -- | -- |
| **File** | `cover.jpg` | `cover_small.jpg` |
| **Size(in pixels)** | 1800x2360 | 200x262 |


### Autocover

A GitBook plugin (`autocover`) can also be used to generate a cover file for you, or just generate the `cover_small.jpg` from your big cover. This plugin is added by default on hosted books.

### Guidelines

A good cover respects the following guidelines:

* No border
* Clearly visible book title
* Any important text should be visible in the small version
